# cinq-test

Follow the instructions on:

  `https://github.com/cinqtechnologies/front-end-angularjs-automate-tasks`
  
with this we'll have our REST service running.

Then navigate to the folder where you cloned this project, open the terminal and run:

  `npm install gulp -g`
  
  `npm install` 
  
  `gulp`
  
with that, we have installed the nescessary dependencies and minified the files with gulp.

Now we need to start our Node proxy(to avoid CORS), on the same terminal run:

  `index.js`
  
to open the app navigate to:
  
  `http://localhost/cinq-test/dist/`
